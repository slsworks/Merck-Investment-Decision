MERCK’S DILEMMA: LICENSE DAVENRIK OR NOT?

Our call: License Davenrik
Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, has always been a market leader in bringing out the best drugs. Looking at the balance sheet and profit and loss details of the company, it is evident that Merck has remarkable cash flows and assets. Now is a good time for Merck to invest in more drugs to maintain a profitable portfolio with high revenue returns as few of their other licenses would be expiring soon.

After weighing the risks and profits of this deal with a decision tree, we got a positive EMV of $13.98 million. Despite the huge cash outflows, Merck should opt to license Davenrik because of its potential for drawing great profits. During the initial 7 years of testing, Merck should sum out at least $570 million including phases 1, 2 & 3- for both depression and weight loss. In 2002, it might get difficult for Merck to balance the costs as there will be a significant drop in the inflows. Despite the deal being a ‘high-risk, high-return deal, we need to go ahead with it because there is a significant probability of success in phase 3.

The amount that Merck can pay for the drug should be less than or equal to the EMV of Davenrik, $13.98 million. Considering that an ideal price would obtain a margin between 15% - 20%, we need to aim for a bid between $11 - 12 million. However, if competitor companies like Pfizer bid a higher amount, we can stretch to a limit of $13.98 mil. Bidding an amount higher than the EMV would make this deal unreasonable. 

If any other potential drug worth $15.1 million is available for licensing, Merck should try to invest in both companies. But considering the chances of consistent outflows for the company, they might be better off with a drug with a higher EMV, especially as they have immediate license expires. But the given information is not sufficient to give an accurate opinion, so we assumed that both the drugs have similar: 
1) consumer targets & associated risks
2) investing cost and time. 
In such a case, even though the difference in EMV between Davenrik and the other drug is not high i.e., $1.1 million, we suggest Merck go with the other drug.

If the cost of launching weight-loss only is $225 million instead of $100 million, it would leave us with an EMV of $5.35 million. The total PV of the project has decreased by almost 60%, just because the cost of weight loss increased. The overall EMV for weight-loss only with 100 million launch cost is -$3.26 million ($1.69 - $4.95 million) which is already a negative number. This shows that even when the price of the drug is 100 million only, it gives a negative EMV. But if the cost increases by $125million only for weight loss, it brings the overall EMV of weight-loss down to -$11.7 million (-$6.75 - $4.95 million). This situation is completely impermissible as the EMV will be down by more than 60% without any chances of a possible increase in the inflows through the weight-loss category. Thus, investing a large sum of amount in weight loss is not suggestible.
